# 🧪 TESTS Checklist

This document outlines the requirements to achieve the maximum score (3/3) for the testing assignment.

## ✅ What Needs to Be Done

### 1. Unit Tests for a Repository/Service
- [ ] Choose any repository or service in the project (e.g., AccountRepository, TransactionRepository, etc.)
- [ ] Write comprehensive unit tests covering all logic in the chosen repository/service
- [ ] Use mocks for all dependencies (no real network or disk access)
- [ ] Ensure tests are honest unit tests (isolated, deterministic)

### 2. Golden Test for a Widget
- [ ] Select any widget in the project (e.g., a custom button, card, or screen)
- [ ] Write at least one golden test for the chosen widget
- [ ] You may use third-party libraries for golden testing

### ⭐️ Bonus: Integration Test
- [ ] Write an integration test for one scenario (e.g., adding/editing/deleting a transaction, changing an account, etc.)
- [ ] The test should cover a real user flow through the app
- [ ] This part is optional but highly recommended for full points and valuable experience
